# Objectives 📌

- Understand mathematical modelling in telecommunications
  Recognize that communication system outputs can be expressed using equations and learn how these can be represented physically through electronic blocks.
  
- Gain familiarity with the Emona Telecoms-Trainer 101 functional modules
  Identify and use modules such as the Adder and Phase Shifter to construct simple mathematical relationships between signals.

- Implement and observe equations using real electronic signals
  Use the Trainer to realize equations such as:


  Output = Signal A + Signal B

  Output = Signal A + Signal B (with phase shift)

  Measure and compare theoretical and actual results.

- Analyze the effect of phase shifts on signal addition
